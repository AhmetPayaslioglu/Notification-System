# Notification-System-
Create a system that allows you to enter an unlimited number of notifications,where each notification consists of the title, content, publication date, expiration date, and the author of the notification.The system can display all notifications or only those that have not yet expired.We can place notifications in different categories (each notification can have one category). When viewing notifications, they can be sorted by title, date of publishing and expiration date, and can be grouped by authors and categories.We can also delete the notifications. The system also allows searching by title and content.
